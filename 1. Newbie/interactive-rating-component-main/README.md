## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scss
- Javascript

### What I learned

I attempted to work with a more "mobile first" approach, having coded the site first through a mobile view, then adapt the site once it reached a certain breakmark.

### Continued development

Continued use of Flexbox and Bootstrap has been very beneficial and creating sites have become noticibly quicker
