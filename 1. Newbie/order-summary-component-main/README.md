## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- SCSS
- BEM Model

### What I learned

I further improved on haveing images (svgs) as backround images.
Further improvement on all 'background-image-' properties and usability

### Continued development

Flexbox and Bootstrap now have become second hand when creating websites.
Further use of padding and margin to tweek layouts will become key to master all layouts.
