## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I used this project to brush up on topics that I were familiar, but not strong with.

My understanding of Bootstrap is my strongest suit. Getting back into the flow of using flexboss and css to place certain items together felt more fluid as the project progessed.

### Continued development

Continued use of Flexbox and Bootstrap will be used in every project due to my familiarity with these concepts.
