## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- SCSS
- BEM Model

### What I learned

I learned that building mobile first formats into desktop and tablet formats is a much easier job than the opposite.

### Continued development

Continued use of Flexbox and Bootstrap will be used in every project due to my familiarity with these concepts.
Padding and Margin have become more of a focus to change layouts.
