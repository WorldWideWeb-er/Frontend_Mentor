## My process

### Built with

- React (!)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- SCSS
- BEM Model

### What I learned

This was my first project using React. I had a few side project that I used to get a grasp of React, but this was putting that knowledge to the test.

Using React, I organized all my files and linked items together with index.js pages to clean up code.

### Continued development

Continued use of Flexbox and Bootstrap will be used in every project due to my familiarity with these concepts.
Padding and Margin have become more of a focus to change layouts.
